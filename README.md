My personal site, built using Gatsby and React with a JAMstack philosophy in mind. All content and configuration is managed in markdown and JSON files in this repository.

## Setup

Doesn't get much simpler than this.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mdalzell/mattdalzell.com.git`
2. Install any needed packages: `npm install`
3. Run the site in develop mode: `npm run develop`
4. Ask yourself "Why did I do this?"
5. Delete the files and move on with your life.
