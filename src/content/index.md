title: 'Hi, I''m Matt Dalzell'
intro: >-
  I am a software engineer based out of Chicago, IL, with 6 years of
  professional experience in both frontend and backend web application
  development. Over the course of my career, I've worked on everything from
  large SaaS platforms to smaller apps for businesses across a variety of
  industries.
    
  My philosophy for software development is that the code is always improving,
  or it is always getting worse; there is no such thing as staying the same. I
  treat refactoring, bug fixing, and testing with the same care as I do writing
  greenfield code. I enjoy the challenge of constructing code that is not only
  functional, but maintainable in the long run.
