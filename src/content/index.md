I am a software engineer based out of Chicago, IL, with 6 years of
professional experience in both frontend and backend web application
development. Over the course of my career, I've worked on everything from
large SaaS platforms to smaller apps for businesses across a variety of
industries.

My philosophy for software development is that the code is always improving,
or it is always getting worse; there is no such thing as staying the same. I
treat refactoring, bug fixing, and testing with the same care as I do writing
greenfield code. I enjoy the challenge of constructing code that is not only
functional, but maintainable in the long run.
