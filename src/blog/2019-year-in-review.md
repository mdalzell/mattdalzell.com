When I look back on 2019, I'll always remember it as a wild year with unforgettable highs and some challenging lows that made it starkly different from any other in my life thus far. Overall, I think I've come out stronger both as a software engineer and as a person from these experiences. Some of my major accomplishments in the past calendar year include the following:

- On November 10th, I married the love of my life, Michelle, in an absolutely beautiful and unforgettable ceremony in Chicago. I can't overstate how much her companionship has supported me and fostered my growth personally and professionally, and our wedding was far and away my absolute pinnacle of the year.
- I've expanded my skills as a software engineer in the past year, perhaps more so than any other year in my career. While at times it was a little bit like being thrown in the deep end, I definitely learned a wide breadth of technologies, which was [one of my 2019 goals](https://mattdalzell.com/blog/2019-new-year-goals/). In particular, I gained more professional experience with cloud providers like AWS and Azure, as well as DevOps tooling including Terraform, Docker, and Jenkins.
- I began to take my data privacy seriously, and I have made a concerted effort to only use tools and platforms that meet my ethical standards regarding user data. I've been using [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/) as my primary operating system, and it's been phenomenal so far. In addition, [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) has been great for email and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) seems to keep getting better as well. I still have a few active accounts with other less-transparent platforms, but hopefully I'll be able to continue to transition my usage away from them.
- Outside of my tech life, I've been trying to become a better citizen to my community and my planet. This includes primarily a multitude of small efforts, like volunteering in my free time or reducing meat and plastic consumption, but I've found these little things have greatly improved my own well-being, and hopefully the well-being of others too.

My career goal for 2019 was to become a more senior software engineer, and with my broadened skill set and additional life experience I believe that I have leveled up quite a bit. I've made a ton of progress in the past year, and I'm hoping to keep that momentum going for 2020.
