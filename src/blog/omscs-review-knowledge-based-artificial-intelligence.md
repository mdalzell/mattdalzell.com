Artificial intelligence is one of the hottest topics within the tech industry as society grapples with understanding how recent advances in the field will impact the economy, media, and more. There possibly has never been a more relevant time to take a class on the subject of AI, so this fall I took Georgia Tech's CS-7637: Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence - Cognitive Systems course. I had previously taken some AI classes as an undergrad at Northwestern, but I was curious to to learn more about how the field has changed in the 10 years since then. Somewhat unfortunately, this class focused largely on classic AI techniques and didn't delve too deeply into newer topics such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or other forms of generative AI.

The class assignments fell into one of three categories: mini-projects, written homeworks, and the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) project. 
* The mini-projects were coding challenges that were roughly related to the lecture material that also required a written report explaining the approach. Somewhat disappointingly, the automated test-suites for the mini-projects could usually be brute-forced, which lead to rather uninteresting solutions and reports. 
* The homeworks were essays answering a prompt related to one of the lecture topics. I actually enjoyed these assignments for the most part, since they often provided an opportunity to be creative.
