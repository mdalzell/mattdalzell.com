As an undergraduate student at Northwestern, I avoided the introduction to databases course because I lacked confidence in my programming abilities. I had always gravitated towards frontend work, finding anything involving data (or worse, math) to be intimidating. So I chose classes that were more aligned with my interests at the time, for better or worse. It all worked out in the end, but I always regretted not taking some of these fundamental courses. Part of the reason I enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program was to fill in some of the gaps from my undergrad with courses like CS 6400: Database Systems Concepts and Design.
