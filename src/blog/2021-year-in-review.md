For me, 2021 has had a sort of strange duality; it was a year of an ongoing pandemic and civil unrest in the United States, while also a year that marked a return to routine and perhaps even to normalcy. Unlike 2020 which was a complete shock to the system, I was fortunate to come out of 2021 without too much major upheaval in my life. 

Compared to last year, my reflections are a lot more subdued, but in many ways are just as impactful to my day-to-day life:

* I am lucky enough to live in a place that had early access to COVID-19 vaccines, and have been vaccinated since the end of the first quarter of the year. I was also luckily was able to get a booster before the Omicron outbreak, so when my wife and I had a brush with the virus at the end of the year we both came out the other side with minimal issues (although cancelling the holidays was a bummer).
* 2021 was the first full year I worked entirely remotely, never setting foot into an office or meetup once. It definitely hasn't always been easy, but working from home has proven to be a great fit for my lifestyle. I have enjoyed optimizing my home office and feel like I can be much more productive here than I ever could be in a shared space. 
* Professionally, it has been a busy year where I've focused mostly on frontend React development. One project in particular was the smoothest I've ever been involved in from start to finish. There were a lot of great lessons in engineering and leadership learned from that project, and hopefully I can bottle up some of that magic and apply it to my future projects.
* About halfway through the year I started thinking about what will come next in my career. To be honest, I'm still thinking about that question, and one avenue I am using to explore my options is returning to academia to earn a master's degree. [I'll be starting Georgia Tech's OMSCS program](https://mattdalzell.com/blog/enrolling-in-omscs/) in January of next year, and I'm hopeful the experience will level up my engineering skills and provide an opportunity to survey parts of the field that I don't always encounter with my day job.
* Throughout all of this, my wife and I have been raising our corgi puppy Biscuit, which has provided its own set of challenges. As stressful as that has been at times, Biscuit has given a lot of joy to both of us, and helped introduce us to half of our neighborhood since **everyone** wants to say hi to a corgi.

I'm really happy with the progress that I've made both personally and professionally in this past year, I appreciate that most of the change this year was incremental rather than sweeping. I'm hoping the relative stability of 2021 will provide a good foundation for 2022, where I'm looking to challenge myself and grow even further.
