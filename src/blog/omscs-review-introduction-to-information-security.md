Towards the end of last year, [I was admitted into Georgia Tech's OMSCS graduate program](https://mattdalzell.com/blog/enrolling-in-omscs/) as part of the Spring 2022 cohort. I chose to enroll in [CS 6035: Introduction to Information Security (IIS)](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6035-introduction-to-information-security) as my first class for a few reasons: it was highly recommended on student forums, it was project-based, and perhaps most importantly, it is a subject area that I'm very interested in. I had never taken a dedicated security course in undergrad, so most of my knowledge up until recently had been learned on the job from mentors or articles on Hacker News. Fortunately, IIS lived up to all of those expectations for me, and I'm very glad to have taken it.

The focus of the class (and 80% of the grade) was on the projects, which for the most part were excellent. There were four projects presented in this course:

* Project 1 involved reading and understanding C code in order to craft input that causes a buffer overflow. I had virtually no experience with this topic, so it was fun to figure things out for the first time. The TAs involved in this project put together an awesome set of videos to help introduce the key concepts and demonstrate how to use gdb. 
* Project 2 required analyzing provided malware samples. Unfortunately this was my least favorite project, since it mostly involved trying to interpret how to somewhat ambigous questions related to the traits in the malware. Another portion of the project involved using a machine learning tool to classify the malware; this was slightly more interesting to me although none of the machine learning concepts used were covered at all in the course material. This is the project I did the worst on, although I still was barely able to scrape by with a very low A.
* Project 3 was centered around public key cryptography and was my favorite project even though it was by far the most challenging. The coding portion was in python, which I am pretty familiar with, so most of the difficulty came from trying to understand the underling principles of modular arithmetic. I basically spent two full weekends on this project, but I ultimately learned a ton and got a high mark as well.
* Project 4 was focused on web security, so this was essentially right in my wheelhouse as an experienced frontend engineer. While I had already largely known about these concepts, it was fun to craft the exploits and "hack" the provided site.

Even though I enjoyed the course and its projects, not everything was perfect. The lectures were pretty helpful at determining what parts of the vast amount of material covered to focus on, but at times could be a little too high level and basic. The book was more thorough, but was incredibly dry and covered a huge amount of material. The exams and quizzes were so short relative to the material covered that I felt they weren't a great gauge of how much material was actually retained, instead just testing if the student knew a particular bit of trivia.\

It was certainly challenging to get back into the student mindset after all these years, but so far the challenge has been worth it to me.
