Many students and alumni of the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech are quick to recommend Prof. [David Joyner](https://www.davidjoyner.net/)'s classes as some of the best in the curriculum. This past fall I enrolled in [CS 6750: Human-Computer Interaction](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6750-human-computer-interaction), hoping the hype on Reddit and [OMSHub](https://www.omshub.org/) was accurate. Fortunately, the class did not disappoint, and I can safely say that this was my favorite course I've taken thus far in the program.
