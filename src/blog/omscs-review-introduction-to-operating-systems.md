On Reddit, OMSCentral, or any other forum of Georgia Tech students, one course that almost always has glowing reviews is [CS 6200: Introduction to Operating Systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems). Although the name may suggest that the course is introductory, it is well known by students to feature challenging projects that serve as a litmus test of whether one can succeed in the OMSCS program. After taking this class in Spring of 2024, I have to completely agree with the past reviews; this is possibly my favorite course that I've taken thus far for my master's degree.
