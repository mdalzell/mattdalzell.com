On Reddit, OMSCentral, or any other forum of Georgia Tech students, one course that almost always has glowing reviews is [CS 6200: Introduction to Operating Systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems). Although the name may suggest that the course is introductory, it is well known by students to feature challenging projects that serve as a litmus test of whether one can succeed in the OMSCS program. After taking this class in Spring of 2024, I have to completely agree with the past reviews; this is possibly my favorite course that I've taken thus far for my master's degree.

As the name suggests, the lectures in this course provide an introduction into some of the basic functions of operating systems, such as threads, scheduling, and virtualization. My understanding is that this course was added to get graduate students "up to speed" if they didn't cover this material in their undergrad degree, which can make the lessons feel a bit dense. I had encountered most of these concepts in the past, however it was so long ago that the lessons acted as a helpful refresher. 

The lectures and accompanying research papers form the basis of the two exams, which together make up 50% of the total grade. Due to the nature of the material, the questions created a situation where "you either know it or you don't," with no real likelihood of deriving the answer on the spot. Both of these exams were fairly challenging, and I received an 82% and 73% on the midterm and final respectively. This was about in line with the median score in both cases.
