Summer semester at Georgia Tech is a speedrun, and my time in [CS6310: Software Architecture and Design (SAD)](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6310-software-architecture-design) absolutely flew by. I knew going in that the compressed schedule of the shortened semester kicks things up to another level, so I chose a subject that I already have a strong background in: software architecture.

The class itself is roughly structured around the software development lifecycle you might see in a real-world project, starting with analyzing requirements and going through the full implementation of a system with a team of other students. Given the timeframe of the class in summer semester, this process moves a lot faster than you'd see at most companies. Initially the assignments are completed individually, but the later stages of the course involve group collaboration. There are also a handful of quizzes that contribute to a modest percentage of the overall grade.

Since I have plenty of professional experience in developing software, there weren't too many totally new concepts for me to take away from this class. The deep dive into object oriented analysis and UML (particularly sequence diagrams) did provide some new perspectives on design, even if those methods might be considered a little outdated by modern standards. 

For me, the highlight of this class was working with my teammates, who were all very thoughtful and responsive when working on our project. Given how reviled classes with group work seem to be within the OMSCS community, I feel very fortunate to have worked with some stellar individuals. The office hours were also extremely helpful, and it was great to have a professor and TAs that are engaged with the students. This collaborative aspect made SAD feel more like an on-campus course than the previous one I took, [Introduction to Information Security](https://mattdalzell.com/blog/omscs-review-introduction-to-information-security/).

In my opinion, this class did have a couple of glaring weaknesses. First, the lecture videos seemed out of date relative to the current structure of the course. My understanding is that the videos were recorded years ago by a professor who is no longer with the class. While there is still value in many of the videos, I think at least a partial refresher with some new or updated content would drastically improve the course.

The bigger issue however is that I feel like the assignments did not scale well to handle hundreds of students due to the ambiguous, bespoke nature of software architecture. Turnaround time for assignment grades was woefully slow, but this is understandable since evaluating these assignments was probably more akin to grading papers rather than the automated assessments seen in programming assignments in other courses. I'm not really sure what the solution would be here - reigning in the assignments would probably help automated grading but would remove one of the most important implicit lessons: how to deal with uncertainty in requirements and a seemingly limitless amount of options to consider.\

Overall, this course was engaging due to the group work, even though I didn't really have to learn anything novel. I do wonder if I will regret taking this course down the road, and if I should have challenged myself more by pursuing a topic I have less experience in. For now though, I am just glad to have successfully completed my second foundational course and my first summer semester.
