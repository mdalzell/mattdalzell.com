Summer semester at Georgia Tech truly is a speedrun, and my time in [CS6310: Software Architecture and Design](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6310-software-architecture-design) absolutely flew by. Fortunately, I knew going in that the compressed schedule of the shortened semester kicks things up to another level, so I chose a subject that I am intimately familiar with: software architecture.

The class itself is roughly structured around the software development lifecycle you might see in a real-world project, starting with analyzing requirements and going through the full implementation of a system with a team of other students. Given the timeframe of the class, this process moves a lot faster than you'd see at most companies outside of early stage startups. Initially the assignments are completed individually, but the later stages of the course involve group work. There are also a handful of quizzes that contribute to a modest percentage of the overall grade.
