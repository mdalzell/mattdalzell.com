Summer semester at Georgia Tech is a speedrun, and my time in [CS6310: Software Architecture and Design](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6310-software-architecture-design) absolutely flew by. I knew going in that the compressed schedule of the shortened semester kicks things up to another level, so I chose a subject that I already have a strong background in: software architecture.

The class itself is roughly structured around the software development lifecycle you might see in a real-world project, starting with analyzing requirements and going through the full implementation of a system with a team of other students. Given the timeframe of the class in summer semester, this process moves a lot faster than you'd see at most companies outside of early stage startups. Initially the assignments are completed individually, but the later stages of the course involve group collaboration. There are also a handful of quizzes that contribute to a modest percentage of the overall grade.

Since I have plenty of professional experience in developing software, there weren't too many totally new concepts for me to take away from this class. The deep dive into object oriented analysis and UML (particularly sequence diagrams) did provide some new perspectives on design, even if those methods might be considered a little outdated by modern standards. For me, the highlight of this class was working with my teammates, who were all very thoughtful and responsive when working on our project. Given how reviled classes with group work seem to be within the OMSCS community, I feel very fortunate to have worked with some stellar individuals.

In my opinion, this class did have a couple of obvious weaknesses.
