Believe it or not, I haven't always been as passionate about programming and software engineering as I am today. I've enjoyed working with computers since a young age, but I had never had much formal computer science education prior to my college years at Northwestern University. 

While pursuing my bachelor's degree at NU, I often found myself struggling to keep up with the coursework; not only did I need to learn the material for the class, but I also felt that I often had to play catch-up with my peers who were much more comfortable working with a variety of programming languages, tools, etc. This was challenging to say the least, and by getting thrown in the deep end I often found myself struggling to stay afloat.\

I stuck it out and earned my degree, and soon after started my career in software engineering. Over the years, I've worked on some amazing projects and have worked with peers and mentors who taught me how to be both a programmer and professional. During all this, I've continued learning more about my field, and I've often wondered what it would be like to revisit an academic environment while actually understanding how to read compiler errors (and properly use StackOverflow).\

These thoughts are the primary reason I've decided to enroll in Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. I spent some time weighing differentoptions (and alternatively considered just continuing learning in an unstructured way as I have for the past eight years), but ultimately I went with Georgia Tech's offering for a few reasons:

* The course selection is excellent, as you would expect from a top tier institution. I think there is a nice balance between practical courses that I could apply to my current work and topics that would broaden my understanding of the field.
* The course format seems well-structured for working professionals. I know these courses will take up a significant portion of my free time, but the seem to be organized in such a way that the amount of effort matters more than working on a synchronized course schedule. Lectures, projects, and tests can all be successfully navigated on just nights and weekends.
* The cost is significantly less than most other graduate degree programs, by a factor of 5 or more in fact. In most cases, a master's degree isn't necessary for software engineering positions, so it was difficult for me to justify spending $50k on a degree when it might not even make a huge difference in my overall compensation.

At the end of the day, I'm mostly pursuing this degree to learn and not just to get a credential. There's a very real chance I might not actually make it out, from what I've seen most students who start the OMSCS program don't finish it. However I don't have much to lose by trying, and at the very least I will hopefully learn in a way that will help me grow both as an engineer and a person.
