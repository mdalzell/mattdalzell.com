Modern society is built upon computer networks. The internet has become the backbone of commerce, entertainment, education, and more. Despite having a decade of experience building applications that leverage this technology, I've never really taken the time to understand how the internet itself works. Sure, I knew the practical applications of HTTP, what a CDN is, and the purpose of a DNS server, but I didn't understand _how_ all of these pieces actually worked together to move bits from one computer to another across a network of routers.
